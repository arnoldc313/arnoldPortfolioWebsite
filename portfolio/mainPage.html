      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>My name is Arnold Contreras. As of today, I am 16 years old and I am going into my senior year of high school. I currently attend Cesar Chavez Academy High School in Detroit Michigan. Some things that I like to do for fun is watch movies, TV, and play video games. Some things that I like to eat are tacos and spaghetti. One thing that I enjoy a lot are computers. Essentially anything that has to do with computers, such as coding or the actual structure of one.
        One thing I am interested in doing is going to college. I would like to get a degree in computer science. This is because I believe I am smart and would like to pursue a higher education.

        <h1>Career Trajectory</h1>
        <p>In two years I see myself in college and studying computer science. I will get here by maintaining a high GPA throughout my final year of high school. I will then apply to the college that I believe suits me best and then study my hardest to the one I choose.
          In five years I see myself in my final years of college pursuing a computer science degree. I would also have a job in web development. To get there I would first have to graduate high school and enroll into a school with a good computer science program. I would then have to study hard and find a good paying web development job.
